# My Portfolio Site
- This is my portfolio website (available at [smrth.dev](https://www.smrth.dev))
- The frontend uses Bootstrap 5 and the backend used Express and Node.js
- All the "content" is dynamically rendered onto the page from an externally hosted JSON file to avoid having to push to GitHub and force a new build to start every time
- It has links to my Resume/CV, my [blog](https://dev.to/httpsamc), an inline form to contact me, and my GitHub
- All URIs in the body have a custom class ("l") that are styled dynamically on load (the colors change every time) to add more pop to the site while not having to deal with doing so for every URI (2 colors in a row are also avoided)
