# [⚡ CasEel ⚡](https://github.com/http-samc/caseel)
A Chrome Extension for autosaving NetMath notebooks!

## What is it?
CasEel adds autosaving functionality to the [NetMath](https://courseware.illinois.edu) platform, which provides interactive digital courses in a variety of math levels and integrates Mathematica as a calculator.

Unfortunately, hard work can be lost in an instant if you forget to save manually. That's why I created CasEel, the autosaver for NetMath.

CasEel automatically calls the save function every 90 seconds, meaning that at most you have just over a minute's worth of work to lose.

It's free to use and available on the Chrome Webstore.

## Contributing
If you can help acomplish any of the TODO's, please make a PR!

Keep in mind CasEel was made specifically for autosaving. There are other great tools, like [AutoCCM](https://github.com/gabeclasson/Auto-CCM) that already implement other quality of life features!

Both of these can coexist as two separate extensions, so there's no need to reinvent the wheel.

## TODO
- Reimplement (functioning) custom save intervals
  - limited at 30 sec. due to concerns of low-delays crashing servers
  - removed due to less-than-optimal communication times between popup.html/popup.js and background.js
- Better background script error handling
- Up manifest to v3
- Automatically save on tab close, even if the running interval isn't up yet
